# Final-Year-Project
## Abstract
A hazy image looks unclear due to fog or pollution, making it hard to see and understand. 
Enhancing clarity by removing fog or haze, revealing details for improved visibility and 
visual quality. This case study focuses on hazy image enhancement using real hazy image 
as the primary dataset. We collect real hazy images that are used in our project. Our project 
is implemented in four parts of algorithms that are: Air light estimation, Creating 
Transmission, Estimate and Refine Transmission, and perform Dehazing using the 
estimated air light and transmission. We have made our custom library that includes all the 
methods which are used in enhancement. After that, we imported this library in another file 
and called this library with passing real hazy image. It will be implemented in Medical 
image enhancing, Real time Object detection for road safety, and CCTV image detection 
for security. The accuracy obtain with the proposed method on the hazy image is 44.019
dB.
